# Wikipedia-Clickstream
An approach to evaluating learning path recommendations in e-learning systems. It employs the capabilities of AI-generated personas by large language models (LLMs) to assess learning paths that align with user preferences and behavior. The proposed system uses Wikipedia clickstream data to recommend learning paths through Wikipedia articles. An LLM, such as GPT-4, simulates expert assessments to validate the learning paths, addressing scalability and efficiency challenges in statistical data collection from human experts for valida-tion. This integration reduces reliance on human expertise and enables real-time evaluation. The system architecture uses MongoDB for tree-like data storage and management, and Flask for streamlined automation of the validation process.
